# PendulumProjectMU_public
This project was given in Robot Control Theory (MT5104) by Dr. Janardhan Vistapalli. The students (Per Henrik Hardeberg and Katrine Als Hansen) was given the task of getting the inverted pendulum to stand, using energy based swing up control, as well as LQR control for balance.

This project is highly inspired by the projects of Mr. Jitendra Singh, such as: https://github.com/jitendra825/Inverted-Pendulum-Simulink
